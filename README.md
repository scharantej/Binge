 ## Problem Statement

Build a Netflix clone using Flask. The application should allow users to browse movies and TV shows, watch trailers, and create and manage their own watchlists.

## Design

The application will consist of the following HTML files:

* `watch.html`: This page will allow users to watch a movie or TV show.
* `mylist.html`: This page will allow users to view and manage their watchlist.

The application will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page.
* `/browse`: The browse page.
* `/watch/<movie_id>`: The watch page for a specific movie or TV show.
* `/mylist`: The mylist page.

## Implementation

The application can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Create a new Flask application.
2. Create the HTML files for the application.
3. Create the routes for the application.
4. Add the necessary CSS and JavaScript files to the application.
5. Test the application.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to a production environment using the following steps:

1. Create a new Heroku application.
2. Add the Flask application to the Heroku application.
3. Deploy the Heroku application.
